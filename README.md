# darkmode

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a basic mechanism on how to handle theme with system & user preference. By default it takes system preference and if user changes the theme then the user setting gets the first preference.

We have just used 2 plugins to achieve this.

1. shared_preferences - to save the theme toggled by user
2. provider - to provide the changes to theme in realtime

To get your theme setup you can use the below link
